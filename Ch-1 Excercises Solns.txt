Python for Informatics:: [ch-1 Excercises Solutions]

1.1- (c)
         Main memory is basically your RAM.
         Secondary Memory is any stoage device it can be HDD, Pen Drives, CD...etc

1.3- 
         compiler convert source code into object code and then executor convert object code
         to low language or machine code
         whereas in interpretor as soon as you type the output is displayed....therefore interpretor 
         converts your source code into machine code simulataneously without converting into 
         object code....

1.4- (c)
         actually in Python, all the ,machine codes or low language codes are stored in the Python.exe
         file....so as soon as you type a code in Python and run...all the codes are converted into machine 
         code and then it is the Python.exe file that actually runs your machine code and displays the result.
         actually Python code gets internally converted into byte code before getting converted into machine
         code..

1.6- (b)
         when  you are running a program from a file....then all the variables and values of the program get 
         stored in RAM....which after the termination of program gets removed from the RAM/Main Memory.
         and when you save the file....the file gets stored in the Secondary Memory viz HDD..etc (Secondary 
         Memory Processing is slower than Main Memory Processing).

1.7- (b)

1.8- 
         we can imagine how fast a vehicle is moving as CPU...CPU and processor of the system are nowadays 
         same itself......
         and the size of the vehicle whether truck..or car...or suv...actually is the RAM or Main Memory..... & the 
         seats basically represent the Secondary Memory.........
         BIOS is the one which links or manages operations between connected devices and CPU or processor
         processing input output operations.....connected devices like keyboard,mouse,speaker,pen drive...any..
